# Numerical Optimization Course - HW2

In this exercise we will:
• Implement Interior Point Method using log-barrier approach
• Test it on constrained optimization problems and visualize performance
• Solve Quadratic Programming and Linear Programming examples

## Running Tests
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_constrained -v
```
